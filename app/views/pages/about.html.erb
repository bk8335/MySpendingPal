<p>Its kind of a joke that we all manage our finances so badly we can barely make it to the end of the month with a positive balance.</p>
<p>Except its not a very funny joke - <%= link_to "46% of American's can't afford a $400 bill", 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/25/the-shocking-number-of-americans-who-cant-cover-a-400-expense/?utm_term=.5fc215ee8ef8' %>.</p>

<p>I want to know what my budget is each day, if I am over/under it, and most importantly, if at the current rate I will run out of money before the end of the month...</p>
<p>So feeling inspired by other companies <%= link_to "that started their life as excel spreadsheets", 'https://levels.io/product-hunt-hacker-news-number-one/'%>, I decided to make something myself.</p>
<p>and hence MySpendingPal was born, so others in a similar predicament, could have something help them to financial safety</p>
